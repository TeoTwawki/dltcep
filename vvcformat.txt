Visual 'spell casting' effects with sounds attached. This kind of file call a BAM file and sometimes a sound one for playing 3D graphical effect. They are called by some script actions like CreateVisualEffect or CreateVisualEffectObject - they are not hardcoded in exe and could be simply made and put in override to use even without chitin.key reference. VVCs are used in the "Play 3D effect" in spells and items.

These files have constant length 1ECh bytes.
