Description

This file format describes the content of an area, rather than its visual representation. It contains the list of actors, items, entrances and exits, spawn points, and other area-associated info. Essentially, this format is all about how the characters interact with the area and how the area responds, whereas the WED file is all about how the area appears graphically.
AREA file versions

    * V1.0: Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, BG2 SoA 
    * V9.1: Icewind Dale II

AREA V1.0

Overall structure

Note: The order of the sections in an AREA file do actually vary. In many files the sections are always found in a particular order. In AREA files, the same resource in its normal state and in its "post-save" state will have the different sections in different orders. The sections here, then, are stored in the order in which they are referenced in the header.

    * File header
    * Actors
    * Info points (and trigger points and exits)
    * Spawn points
    * Entrances
    * Containers
    * Items
    * Vertices
    * Ambients
    * Variables
    * "Explored" bitmask
    * Doors
    * Animations
    * Automap notes
    * Tiled objects
    * Songs entries
    * Sleep option interruption by appearing creatures

V1.0 File header
Offset Size (data type) Description
0x0000 4 (char array) Signature ('AREA')
0x0004 4 (char array) Version ('V1.0')
0x0008 8 (resref) The resref of the WED file corresponding to this file.
0x0010 4 (dword) This field is called m_lastSaved in the BG source. There is always 0 value for original areas and diffetrent values for savegames output areas. It is just counter of the time when the area was saved in seconds of real time.
0x0014 4 (dword) Area flag - according to the ToB IDS file AREAFLAG.IDS  (values valid also for BG1/ToTSC/IWD/HoW/ToTL  however except value 2).

    * 0 - normal state
    * 1 - save/rest option not available
    * 2 - tutorial
    * 4 - no magic works
    * 8 - area is black/white colored

For IWD2 a value of 4 is marked as 'LOCKBATTLEMUSIC' in areaflag.ids

In PS:T we may find there some strange values that obviously have different function than in BG/BG2 or IWD - I have no idea what is this used for in this game: examples :

    * 02 in AR0104C
    * 04 in AR0200
    * 06 in AR1500

0x0018 8 (resref) Resref of the area to the North of this area. Not used in BG2/IWD
0x0020 4 (dword) (usually 3, sometimes 1) and in BG2/IWD usually 0
0x0024 8 (resref) Resref of the area to the West of this area. Not used in BG2/IWD
0x002c 4 (dword) (usually 3, sometimes 1) and in BG2/IWD usually 0
0x0030 8 (resref) Resref of the area to the South of this area. Not used in BG2/IWD
0x0038 4 (dword) (usually 3, sometimes 1) and in BG2/IWD usually 0
0x003c 8 (resref) Resref of the area to the East of this area. Not used in BG2/IWD
0x0044 4 (dword) (usually 3, sometimes 1) and in BG2/IWD usually 0
0x0048 2 (word) Flags: according to the AREATYPE.IDS in ToB

    * bit 0: Outdoor
    * bit 1: day/night
    * bit 2: weather
    * bit 3: city
    * bit 4: forest
    * bit 5: dungeon
    * bit 6: extended night
    * bit 7: can rest indoors

Also here I have noticed some weird values in PS:T - for example in city areas - value 0104 here - I have no idea why it is like this.
0x004a 2 (word) Rain probability
0x004c 2 (word) Snow probability
0x004e 2 (word) Fog probability (Non-functional)
0x0050 2 (word) Lightning probability
0x0052 2 (word) Unknown, however I noticed that in all games other than BG1/ToTSC this value is always zero. In case of BG1 in the outdoors areas there are numbers other than zero - maybe flags of some sort ? Maybe it is used to control the weather somehow ?
0x0054 4 (dword) Offset of actors (i.e. creatures and NPCs).
0x0058 2 (word) Count of actors in this area (i.e. creatures and NPCs).

V9.1 File header (Same as V1.0 but 16 bytes longer)
0x0054 4*4 (dword) Unknown,unused
and the rest is shifted by 0x10 bytes

V1.0 Actors
Offset Size (data type) Description
0x0000 32 (char array) Name of this actor (may override scripting name)
0x0020 4 (point) Current position of this actor within the area.
0x0024 4 (point) Current destination of this actor within the area.
0x0028 4 (dword) Field availability flags
    * bit 0 - actor is not loaded (not embedded in are)
    * bit 1 - ?
    * bit 2 - ?
    * bit 3 - override scriptname with label

0x002c 4 (dword) Unknown (usually 0), unused (no effects in game) ?

0x0034 4 (dword) It's the orientation of the actor (values between 0-15 , 0 for the NPC looking south and clockwise as the scriptcompiler.doc tell us)
0x0038 4 (dword) Unknown (usually FFFF FFFF, I have noticed only that if this value is set to 0 or other small ?! value then actor is not present)
0x003c 4 (dword) Unknown (usually 0), unused (no effects in game) ?
0x0040 4 (dword) Determines the presence or not of the actor in the cycle of day / night  (it's not the visible flag). 

There is probably some system that describes all possible time intervals when  creatures are spawned - for now I know only that when 2nd offset is set to 00 and 4th offset is set to FF we have the effect that takes place at night in time interval defined probably in 1st and 3rd offset. The analogical situation for day is when 2nd offset is set to FF and 4th to 00. However I have no idea how to define correctly for example that creatures are spawned from 8 hour of day to , say 11.  

Known values :

    * F0FF 0F00 - day
    * E0FF 0100 - dawn
    * 0F00 F0FF - night
    * 1F00 FEFF - dusk
    * FF00 FFFF - unknown
    * 3F00 E0FF - unknown
    * FFFF FFFF - always

0x0044 4 (dword) Unknown (usually 0), probably unused, no visible effects in game
0x0048 8 (resref) Resref of a dialog file associated with this creature. Presumably this is so that a creature can have their own dialog overridden in specific areas.
0x0050 8 (resref) Resref of a script file ("override" script). As in the CRE  file, there appear to be 5 slots for scripts, not all of which need be occupied.
0x0058 8 (resref) Resref of a script file ("class" script)
0x0060 8 (resref) Resref of a script file ("race" script)
0x0068 8 (resref) Resref of a script file ("general" script)

0x008c 4 (dword) Size of stored CRE structure
0x0090 128 (bytes) Unknown. Unused. Most of these bytes are probably placeholders for fields which are used in-memory by either the game or the editor, since many of them contain what appears to be garbage of the sort which is left by not initializing a block of memory.
V1.0 Info points, trigger points, and exits

Note: These are referred to as info points. A more appropriate name might be "active regions"; the name "Info point" comes from the names seen in the file as assigned to the various objects. Likely, the Bioware editors automatically name these as "Info point 1", "Info point 2", ..., and "Trigger point 1", "Trigger point 2", ..., and "toXXXX", where XXXX is replaced with the 4-digit area specifier (i.e. AR2600 == 2600, etc). This can be seen in that many of the names will appear as "Name1\0oint 3" -- i.e. the old name can be seen, only having been partially overwritten. Anyway, some of the objects are, in fact, info points, but many of them are exits or "trigger points" (e.g. traps and other special regions). This section has C4h bytes.

V1.0 Variables

Each area can have associated variables. Variables not associated with an area are associated with either "GLOBAL" for global variables, or "LOCALS" for local variables. This stores variables associated with this particular area (this is keyed on the resref of this area, which is assumed to be a 6 character code, even though a resref is 8 characters long). For instance, the variable accessed via 'Global("AR2600","FooBarDead")' would be stored in the ARE file for AR2600. Typically these blocks are found only in saved ARE files (i.e. extracted from .SAV files.). The structure, as much as is known, is:
Offset Size (data type) Description
0x0000 32 (char array) Name of this variable.
0x0020 8 (bytes) Unknown
0x0028 4 (dword) Variable value
0x002c 40 (bytes) Unknown
V1.0 Explored bitmask

The explored bitmask is an array of bits, one bit for each 16x16 pixel cell on the map. If a bit is 1, then the cell has been explored. Otherwise, it has not.
V1.0 Doors

Doors in an AREA file are the "door" objects that the user interacts with, to be distinguished from the "door" objects in the WED file. The WED file deals with how the opening and closing of a door changes the appearance of the world. A door in an AREA file details what happens when the user tries to open the door, what polygon the mouse must be inside of in order for mouse clicks to affect the door in question. The two types of door objects are linked through the id field in each -- the 8-byte character array which contains an identifier for the door. If the names in the two files match, the doors are the same, and toggling the state of the AREA door will toggle the state of the WED door. The name "doors" includes also all possible "secret doors" that appear on the wall after longer examination of it or using "detect trap" ability.
This section has C8 (200) bytes.
Offset Size (data type) Description
0x0000 32 (char array) A long name for this door. Could be used by scripts.
0x0020 8 (char array) A short identifier for this door. Probably used to establish a mapping between doors in the AREA file and doors in the WED file.
0x0028 4 (dword) Flags related to this door. It probably controlls if door is open or closed (since the value is changed in case of opened door)

But also :

    * Bit 0 : if set to 1 then door is open (reverse for PST)
    * Bit 1 : defines whether door is locked or not
    * Bit 2 : reset trap, so it must be disarmed
    * Bit 3 : detectable trap
    * Bit 4 : broken door
    * Bit 5 : seem to be intern doors.
    * Bit 6 : blocking trigger when
    * Bit 7 : door is secret, detect trap ability may be used to detect them , also the sound of opening/closing is different,
    * Bit 8 : found hidden door

V1.0 Animations
Section size : 48h bytes.
Offset Size (data type) Description
0x0000 32 (char array) A long name for this animation. Used by editors and probably by scripts
0x0020 4 (point) The point at which the "center" of the animation is to be played -- i.e. each frame in the BAM file has its center placed at this precise coordinate.
0x0024 4 (dword) Time of playing animation in day/night cycle. 

There is probably some system that describes all possible time intervals when animation is played - for now I know only that when 2nd offset is set to 00 and 4th offset is set to FF we have the effect that takes place at night in time interval defined probably in 1st and 3rd offset. The analogical situation for day is when 2nd offset is set to FF and 4th to 00. However I have no idea how to define correctly for example that ambient is played from 8 hour of day to , say 11. 

Known values :

    * F0FF 0F00 - day
    * E0FF 0100 - dawn
    * 0F00 F0FF - night
    * 1F00 FEFF- dusk
    * FF00 FFFF - unknown
    * 3F00 E0FF - unknown
    * FFFF FFFF - always

0x0034 4 (dword) Flag, so far there is known the following :

    * Bit 0 : Determines whether animation is shown (set to 1) or not (set to 0)
    * Bit 1 : Turns on (value 0) the shades (i.e. smoke of fire)  or turns off (value 1)
    * Bit 2 : If set to 1 then the whole animation is shaded (harder to notice) during night and normal during day.
    * Bit 3 : If set to 1 then animation is stopped on frame specified in offset 0x0032. If set to 0 then the animation is played normally. 
    * Bit 4 : Synchronised draw
    * Bit 5 : unknown
    * Bit 6 : Not covered by wall

V1.0 Tiled objects

This information comes from Dmitry Jemerov. Neither of us have seen any instances of areas which include objects of this type, but he has managed to determine the format of these objects, nonetheless.
