Description

This file is generally declaration of variables used for scripting purposes in Planescape Torment. Without it one may not introduce new variables.

Alphabetical order of entering variables sections in these files is required for the variable type to use variable defined in such a way in PS:T.

Name of variable should be put in appropriate section to work ( Global in Globals section , Kaputz variable in Kaputz section and so on ... ) The alphabetic order is not needed.

Comment on Kaputz variables : KAPUTZ Globals are like Sprite_is_Dead globals.

It means that the variables are sorted by type in ascending order.

Files of this type are put in main game folder (var.var file)

The file has the following structure :
