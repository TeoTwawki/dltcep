0x000a 2 (word) Usage 1. This is the first parameter passed when CreateItem is called from a script, for instance. This value probably means "the number of 'primary' uses of this item". For quantity items, this is a quantity. For some magical items, this is a number of charges. (Some items may have more than one usable magical aspect -- for instance, cast fireball 5 times and aganazzar's scorcher 10 times. In a case like that, this would be 5.)
0x000c 2 (word) Usage 2. This is the second parameter passed when CreateItem is called from a script, for instance. This value probably means "the number of 'secondary' uses of this item". (For items which have more than one usable aspect -- for instance, cast fireball 5 times and aganazzar's scorcher 10 times. In a case like that, this would be 10.)
0x000e 2 (word) Usage 3. This is the third parameter passed when CreateItem is called from a script, for instance. This value probably means "the number of 'tertiary' uses of this item".
0x0010 4 (dword) Flags. 

    * bit 0 (0x01) is set, it means "identified" 
    * bit 1 (0x02) is set, it means "unstealable"
    * bit 2 (0x04) is set, it means "stolen".
