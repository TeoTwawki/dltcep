CFB - casting feature block
  These effects are applied on the caster before casting the spell, regardless of caster level.
  In DLTC we use it to decrease the spell points by spell level. The CFB cannot use pre-target.

IDS targeting (In BG2)
  Creatures (npcs, pcs, monsters) all have object identifiers
  These are: EA (enemy-ally), GENERAL, RACE, CLASS, SPECIFIC, GENDER, ALIGNMENT.
  In many spell effects one can target a particular creature selected by one of these 7 identifiers.
  For IDS targeting you must set  the IDS file in param #2 (EA=2,..., ALIGN=8)
  And the particular IDS value in param #1.
  You can also set level limits in the die rolls fields for all such effects.
  Die rolls: max level, die size: min level.
  In IWD2 this may be slightly different.

IE fileformats
  Well, you must know those :)
  See IESDP.

NON-IE fileformats
  TBG - teambg format
  It is essentially the original file plus the string references from dialog.tlk.
  There are several variants of the TBG format: tbg1, tbg2, tbg3, tbg4 and tbgn.
  See IESDP.
  DLTCEP does not handle the obsoleted tbg1 and tbg2 formats and can export only 
  tbg4.

  IAP - teambg format
  It is a bunch of normal and TBG files stuck together for easier distribution.
  See IESDP.

  TBGC - modified teambg format
  This fileformat has been created to port creature soundsets.
  It is almost the same as a tbg4 file, except the signature is altered to tbgc
  and the raw file block contains only the original strrefs of the creature.
  The filename is the same as the creature's original name.

  CFB.BIN - own fileformat to store level based casting features
  It is simply a raw binary effect data normally found in spells (and items).
  Its size has be a multiplication of 48 bytes, because a spell effect is 48 bytes long.
  Special data:
   1. fill the resource field with ******** to replace it with the actual spell name.
   2. fill the param # fields with ++++ to replace them with the spell level.
   3. fill the param # fields with ---- to replace them with the negative spell level.
  This simple feature was developed to keep track of spells via variables
  (by decreasing spellpoints or the number of memorised spells etc).

  PLY - own fileformat to store polygons
  This is a simple fileformat to store polygons (.wed or .are). It consists of a 8 byte IE-like signature.
  A vertex count (stored on on short). And (x,y) vertices stored on short pairs.

  D - WeiDU dialog source format
  It is a dialog dumped (decompiled) in (almost) human readable format. It resembles scripting code.
  It contains text and journal entries which need to be inserted in dialog.tlk.
  See WeiDU user's guide.

  TIZ - tispack format
  This is a compressed tileset. It must be decompressed before using in a game.
