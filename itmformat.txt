ITM file format

Description

An ITM file describes any item that can appear in the inventory of any creature. Some ITM files do not describe objects the user would typically have in their inventory -- for instance, many monsters have attacks which are special items that don't appear elsewhere in the game. In Torment, there is the additional complication that objects can have associated dialog resources; hence, it is possible to create items with which the character can carry on conversations. The same thing is possible in BG2, however it is done in easier way.

Extended Header:

If an item affects other creatures (like a weapon), casts a spell (like a wand), or has any other effects besides equipping effects then the item file contains an extended header. One Extended Header is required for each ability of an item.
 
Roughly speaking, each "ability" (I believe this to be the terminology used in the Bioware tools) corresponds to a different way to use the item. For instance, in BG, there is an item which can be either a melee (hand-to-hand) axe, or a throwing axe. Or the "wand of fire" which fires either fireballs or "aganazzar's scorcher". To choose which, you click on the item while it is selected, and you are given a menu to choose the ammunition type -- the same procedure used for selecting different missile types for a missile weapon. (Note, also, that it is possible to get an info screen for a bow, for instance, in which all of the "abilities" of the bow are listed -- namely the different types of ammunition it fires. I suspect that it is no coincidence that the same interfaces are used to select "abilities" of an item, and differing ammunition types of a launcher; likely the game internally handles different ammunition types via the same interface it uses for abilities.).

0x0022 2 (chars) Chars for inventory portrait BAM resource index. The BAM resource used on the inventory screen is determined as follows: If these characters are spaces, no resource is used. Otherwise, depending on whether the character is Small, Medium, or Large, WPS, WPM, or WPL is prepended to the characters. This is then used as a BAM resource name for graphics which are superposed on top of the character portrait. To accommodate hands and the like, empty spaces are left in these graphics. Similar procedures are used to choose animation resources for other graphics and animations which need to be specific to particular equipment types and/or character types.

0x0070 2 (word) Count of "global" (i.e. not attached to a specific ability) effect structs
0x0072 4 (dword) These appear to be more flags, similar to the flags appearing earlier in the header. It is unclear what their function may be; they appear to be highly correlated with the earlier flags. Notably, many "important" items, like "Celestial Fire" have different flags here.
0x0076 4*6 (dword array) These are still completely mysterious. (There are only a few data points which have these set to a non-zero value, which means that it is very difficult to establish any real meaning behind these fields; I'm looking into the purpose of these fields.

ITM V1.1 Abilities

Roughly speaking, each "ability" (I believe this to be the terminology used in the Bioware tools) corresponds to a different way to use the item. For instance, in BG, there is an item which can be either a melee (hand-to-hand) axe, or a throwing axe. Or the "wand of fire" which fires either fireballs or "aganazzar's scorcher". To choose which, you click on the item while it is selected, and you are given a menu to choose the ammunition type -- the same procedure used for selecting different missile types for a missile weapon. (Note, also, that it is possible to get an info screen for a bow, for instance, in which all of the "abilities" of the bow are listed -- namely the different types of ammunition it fires. I suspect that it is no coincidence that the same interfaces are used to select "abilities" of an item, and differing ammunition types of a launcher; likely the game internally handles different ammunition types via the same interface it uses for abilities.).
Offset Size (datatype) Description
0x0000 1 (byte) Ability "type":

    * 0: default type? (mostly potions and miscellaneous items)
    * 1: melee attack (non-ranged attacks)
    * 2: ranged attack (both for ammunition and for throw weapon types)
    * 3: magical effect?
    * 4: launcher -- enables use of some "ranged attack" items which require a launcher

0x0001 1 (byte) 1 if item must be identified before this ability can be used, 0 otherwise
0x0002 2 (word) Unknown!
0x0004 8 (resref) icon to represent this ability wherever it needs to be displayed in the GUI
0x000c 2 (word) Selectable target type for this ability:

    * 1: living actor
    * 2: inventory
    * 3: dead actor
    * 4: any point within range
    * 5: caster
    * other values?

0x000e 2 (word) Range for this ability
0x0010 2 (word) Launcher type required for this ability:

0x001c 2 (word) Damage type:

    * 0: none?
    * 1: piercing (also appears to be set for some magical attacks, though it is likely ignored in these cases -- i.e. damage specified as 0d6+0)
    * 2: crushing
    * 3: slashing
    * 4: missile

0x001e 2 (word) Number of attached Effect structs for this ability. Note that not all abilities are designed in terms of effects. For instance, standard weapon damage doesn't require any effects, since it is just a to-hit bonus, a die specification, a damage bonus, and a damage type.
0x0020 2 (word) Index of first attached Effect structs for this ability.
0x0022 2 (word) Number of times this ability can be used before it is exhausted
0x0024 2 (word) Unknown. Appears that it might be related to the previous field...

0x0028 2 (word) Unknown.
0x002a 2 (word) Unknown.
0x002c 2*3 (word array) Unknown. This appears to be three percentages, though. For missile weapons they are all 0, and for all other types of items, they add up to exactly 100, each being in the range 0-100. It is unknown what these code for.
0x0032 2 (word) 1 if this is an "arrow" type projectile, 0 else
0x0034 2 (word) 1 if this is an "bolt" type projectile, 0 else
0x0036 2 (word) 1 if this is a miscellaneous missile weapon (thrown, or launched from a sling). 0 else
